          evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle programme, particularly the PSLV
          configuration. After working for two decades in ISRO and mastering
          launch vehicle technologies, Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of

          to the weaponisation of strategic missile systems and the Pokhran-II
          nuclear tests in collaboration with Department of Atomic Energy, which
          made India a nuclear weapon State. He also gave thrust to
          self-reliance in defence systems by progressing multiple development
          tasks and mission projects such as Light Combat Aircraft.Dr. Kalam
          took up academic pursuit as Professor, Technology & Societal

          involved in teaching and research tasks. Above all he took up a
          mission to ignite the young minds for national development by meeting
          high school students across the country. In his literary pursuit four
          of Dr. Kalam's books - "Wings of Fire", "India 2020 - A Vision for the
          New Millennium", "My journey" and "Ignited Minds - Unleashing the
          power within India" have become household names in India and among the
          Indian nationals abroad. These books have been translated in many
